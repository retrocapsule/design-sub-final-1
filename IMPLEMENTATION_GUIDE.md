   - Implement form validation for all forms
   - Test all user flows thoroughly
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness

5. **Deployment Preparation:**
   - Set up production database
   - Configure Stripe for production
   - Set up file storage in production

## Technical Notes

### Database Schema
The database schema is designed to handle the core entities of the application:
- Users (regular users and admins)
- Design Requests (with status tracking)
- Files (for completed designs)
- Comments (for communication)

If needed, additional models can be added to the schema as the application grows.

### Authentication
The authentication system uses NextAuth.js with a credentials provider, but could be extended to support social logins if desired.

### File Storage
The current implementation has placeholders for AWS S3 integration, but this could be replaced with Cloudinary, Uploadthing, or another file storage service based on requirements.

### Stripe Integration
The Stripe integration is set up for subscription payments, with plans defined in the environment variables. The webhook handling will need to be implemented to ensure subscription statuses are kept in sync.
